		<h3>About Us</h3>
		
		<br> Our culture defines us … it's our DNA. We call it the
			Laptop World Way and it's the values we share and the business
			practices we deploy. It's how we address our day-to-day commitments.
			The Lenovo Way is embodied in the statement: We do what we say and we
			own what we do. That culture also drives how we work every day,
			utilizing what we call the 5 P's: We PLAN before we pledge. We
			PERFORM as we promise. We PRIORITIZE the company first. We PRACTICE
			improving every day. We PIONEER new ideas. Our culture is what has
			enabled us to consistently raise the bar on delivering break-through
			innovations, award-winning designs and strong financial performance.
